# Barry's Time Adventures

[WARNING: SPOILERS] Read only if you've already finished the game, or don't mind knowing what's going to happen.

## Time Limit

You have ~30 in-game days to prepare. This shouldn't be a surprise. It's possible that Barry receives a warning from a mysterious source - a source that appears to know personal information about him.

## Progression

### Route 1: Barry

Barry is confident and impulsive to the point of recklessness.

#### Phase 1: Resource Collection

Barry has a set amount of time to prepare for The Event, getting as many basic needs as possible, while getting rid of fiat currency and anything else that would be less useful.

Remaining time is visible. It's not clear what will happen

At the end of time, Barry is suddenly jumped to the future (100-2000 years).

#### Phase 2: Exploration

Barry explores the ruins of the dead world he ends up in. He uses up resources as he explores, and trains stats which allow. Eventually, he finds the source of the time holes, and attempts to fix it.

Along the way, he unlocks:

- Ability to see what happened in the past (timeline).
- Ability to see events that happened in the past (timeline detail).
- Ability to communicate with Past Barry (change timeline).
- Upgrades which can be applied to the past. These take effect immediately.
- Ability to fix paradoxes caused by applied upgrades (restart in the past).
- Ability to swap places with Future Barry (loop the future).

Looping causes Barry to keep some permanent stat progress, but also causes him to lose a bit of sanity each time. Looping is essential to progression.

The last exploration results in Barry attempting to fix the time hole problem, but making it much worse. All Barrys from all timelines (from looping) end up together. They decide to fix the dead Earth problem by populating it with Barry copies.

#### Phase 3: Convergence

Barry, Robert, and Melissa all end up together. Barry makes some terrible decisions, Robert feels too guilty to stand up to him, Melissa {TODO} can't bring herself to stop him due to some past thing with them.

### Route 2: Robert

Robert is Barry's neighbor. Despite being outwardly friendly, Robert hates Barry for petty reasons (HOA-type stuff), and goes out of his way to make his life difficult.

#### Phase 1: Revenge

Robert's goal is to make life as difficult as possible for Barry. There is no time limit; he just needs to build up the resources necessary for each event.

#### Phase 2: Redemption

After Barry's disappearance, Robert learns (somehow?) that Barry knew of his hatred, and realizes that he's been the asshole all along.

Unlike Barry, Robert spent all he had on hurting Barry, so starts phase 2 with no resources, and has to build them up.

{TODO} For some reason, Robert can only move forward in time, so each reset jumps a specific distance (10 years). Maybe he's just a reasonable person and understands that changing the past is a _terrible idea_.

Robert's focus is on survival (get more done before jumping) and redemption (leave documents or technology in places he knows Barry will visit in the future).

#### Phase 3: Convergence

Same as Route 1, but from a Robert's perspective.

Barry, Robert, and Melissa all end up together. Robert has many different decisions he can make, but his guilt prevents him from doing what he needs to do (stop Barry from making bad decisions). All decisions eventually lead to the same place.

### Route 3: Melissa

#### Phase 1: Research

Melissa has powerful control over time anolmalies {TODO give this a unique name}, and can look forward at all possible decisions and see the consequences. She looks forward enough to see what Barry is going to do (destroy the world, then take over the world, then destroy the world again). In order to stop this, she needs to

Her first phase requires her to manipulate Jim into hating Barry, so that Jim will help in the future.

#### Phase 2: Decisions

Her second phase plays out like Barry's second, but is her planning out in advance how to reach the convergence, and the reset mechanic is starting over her planning from the beginning. The more decisions she sees, the more (realtime) time it takes to decide.

#### Phase 3: Convergence

Same as Route 1, but from Melissa's perspective.

Barry, Robert, and Melissa all end up together. Melissa can see what will happen, but refuses to stop Barry, because all ways of stopping him result in his death.

### Route 4: Continuation

#### Phase 1: Expansion

With no one to stop Barry #{loopCount}, he creates a copy of himself. The copies begin to

The Barry population rapidly expands, straining the planet's resources. Mutations are rampant. Later Barrys aren't remotely viable, as each new copy strays farther from the original.

When the population hits 6 billion, the creation of new Barrys can't outpace the deaths of existing Barrys, and the population begins to collapse.

#### Phase 2: Collapse

The Barry population quickly collapses, resulting in the death of every Barry on the planet.

## UI

### News/Messages

These are always visible, as the story is a main draw of the game.

### UI during phases

UI can change during phases and routes. Only the news needs to stay static.

### Minimize tab switching

Tabs can be very useful, but can also hide important information, like when something new becomes available. Keep them to a minimum outside mobile.

When using tabs, have a notification that something new is available.

Make tabs VERY clear that they are tabs.

### Column layout

Multiple resources and upgrades visible at once. 3 resources may be the maximum while still leaving room for news.

- [Idle Momentum](https://idlemomentum.com/) does a great job with this. There's no need for a separate resource box in the first phase.
